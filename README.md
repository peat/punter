# Punter

This is a simple tool for configuring, starting, and stopping servers in Amazon's EC2 cloud. It's specifically geared towards "one off" deployment and light weight prototyping.

If you're looking for sophisticated deployment and dependency management, I suggest you look at [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) or [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/)  -- they're quite nice for bigger deployments and complex configurations.

_Punter_ has four basic tasks:

- Starting servers
- Stopping servers
- Listing running servers
- Listing server configurations

Out of the box, it's configured to start Ubuntu 12.04 LTS images on "small" EC2 instances with EBS storage. If you're not sure what that means, check out the [AWS Instance Types](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#instance).

_Punter_ works by stitching together shell scripts found in the `fragments/` directory, and running them on the server after it boots. Pretty simple!

## Installation

_Punter_ is a set of Ruby rake tasks; as such, please install Ruby 1.9.2 and the `bundler` gem. Run `bundle install` in the _Punter_ root directory to install the other Ruby dependencies.

Then, update the `config.yml` file with your [AWS credentials](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials#access_credentials) and the name of your default [EC2 key pair](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home#s=KeyPairs).

## Running

To see the available configuration _profiles_:

```
$ rake profiles
basic:
       Fragments: basic
  Security Group: default
   Key Pair Name: YOUR_AWS_KEYPAIR_NAME

ruby:
       Fragments: basic, ruby
  Security Group: default
   Key Pair Name: YOUR_AWS_KEYPAIR_NAME

credit:
       Fragments: basic, credit
  Security Group: default
   Key Pair Name: YOUR_AWS_KEYPAIR_NAME
```

This lists out the names of each profile, and the script _fragments_ they use. 

In the first case, `basic` is the name of a profile that just runs the `basic` fragment. Second, the `ruby` profile stitches together the `basic` and `ruby` fragments. The `lamp` profile stitches together the `basic` and `lamp` fragments. Simple, 'eh?

```bash
$ rake start PROFILE=basic
```

This will start a server with the `basic` profile. Easy.

What servers are currently running?

```bash
$ rake servers
PROFILE     IP               INSTANCE    STATUS         STARTED
basic       123.45.67.8      i-98e4a9e2  running        2012-09-13 22:37:12 UTC
basic                        i-26f5b85c  terminated     2012-09-13 22:45:04 UTC
```

This will list out all of the servers running on your AWS account, with the profile they started with, IP, AWS instance identifier, and a startup timestamp.

Maybe you want to terminate a server?

```bash
$ rake terminate INSTANCE=i-12345678
Terminate the server running the 'ruby' profile at 23.45.67.89? [y/N]
Terminating.
```

It's interactive, and gives you a bit of information so that you can avoid a gnarly _OH SHIT_ moment.

## Fragments

Fragments are the building blocks of a profile: `bash` scripts that are concatenated together, then run as _root_ on the box, immediately after it boots. The `basic` fragment is the simplest of the bunch:

```bash
# update packages
apt-get update
apt-get -y upgrade

# install packages we always want
apt-get -y install git-core tmux
```

All fragments can be found in the `fragments` directory.

Fragments also support ERB templating. Here's `fragments/credit.sh.erb`:

```ruby
<%= runtime_log("User #{`whoami`.chomp} started this server at #{Time.now}") %>
```

Please note that the ERB is evaluated _before_ you start the server.

## Profiles

A _profile_ is simply a list of fragments to put together, and is specified in the `profiles.yaml` file. For example:

```yaml
ruby:
  fragments:
    - basic
    - ruby
  security-groups:
    - ssh
```

This specifies that the `ruby` profile is dependent on the `basic` and `ruby` fragments, and that it will belong to the `ssh` security group (assuming you have it configured on EC2). 

_Punter_ will look for both `.sh` and `.sh.erb` fragments for a given name, so don't worry about the extension.

To inspect the the completely assembled and rendered profile before you start a server with it, you can inspect it. For example:

```bash
$ rake inspect PROFILE=credit
```

That displays the entire `credit` profile, including a rendered ERB fragment.

## Logging

You can check the status of a new instance by looking at the `/punter.log` file on the server. It's not particularly detailed, but it can help you figure out what the system is doing, and if it's completed setting up the environment. For example, the log for a `ruby` profile looks like this:

```
STARTED PROFILE ruby
Started fragment 'basic'
Finished fragment 'basic'
Started fragment 'ruby'
Finished fragment 'ruby'
COMPLETED PROFILE ruby. Have fun!
```

_Punter_ automatically adds the profile and fragment starting and finishing messages.
